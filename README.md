## Product Vision
---
### Near Vision
Our near vision is based on the high level features of the app. The system will have a login page for users to login or create profiles.

The users would be able to create & delete profiles while also being able to upload photos. The system will allow users to connect to Instagram and also be able to view other user's Instagram profiles. The system will collect information about based on their interests, skills, and attitude/personality. The system will have an algroithm that allows users to swipe left/right on another user's profile. The system will have in-app messaging for users to communicate with each other.
<br/>

### Far Vision
Our far vision is based on low level features. For example, users will be able to pick between 15mi radius and up to 50 mi radius. Users will be able to block or hide profiles from certain users of their choice. If a user likes another user enough after their adventure they will be given the option to rate them and also go on another adventure with them, should they choose to do so.

### Backlog Ordering Rationale
To order our backlog we first wrote out a foundation of user stories we felt covered the primary functionality of the application. We then grouped those user stories by their similarity and came up with four main epics. The epics are: user profile, user matching, in-app messaging, and third-party integrations. We then prioritized those epics based on logical ordering of how they should be delivered. This grouping and ordering of stories allows us to focus on building out the foundation of the primary features of the application, which we can iterate on later if needed.

### PBI - Definition of Ready
The group elected to use the “INVEST” criteria for evaluating the quality of our user stories.  

  - “I” ndependent: User stories are reviewed, and if necessary, removed, in order to ensure 
		    the remaining user stories do not conceptually overlap, if possible.
 		    Independence also gives flexibility in the order with which each story is 
		    implemented into the project.

  - “N” egotiable:  Each user story is negotiable; that is, details and the finer points can 
		    be ironed out during development.  Having the core idea captured in the 
		    user story is key to being able to prioritize and schedule for the sprint.
		    
  - “V” aluable:    Every user story needs to be valuable to the customer in the project.  When
 		    splitting stories or creating Epics, it's crucial for the customer to see 
		    the perceived value in order to better understand their importance.

  - “E” stimable:   In order to implement a user story within a sprint, the story has to be 
		    estimable.  Understanding the story and the work entailed is also part of 
		    being negotiable which contributes to a more reasonable, not necessarily 
	   	    exact estimate which allows for better prioritization for scheduling in a 
		    sprint.

  - “S” mall:	    The size of a user story is important for estimating the level of effort, and
		    keeping user stories small typically leads to more accurate estimates.  The 
		    descriptions for user stories can also be small as, once again, capturing 
		    the core idea of the story is the prirmary focus when creating the story. The
		    details are usually hashed out in future conversations for each sprint.
		      
  - “T” estable:    User stories need to be testable, and when creating a user story, part of 
		    understanding the work being documented is also knowing a test could be 
		    written for it.  If a clear test cannot be written, the story may not be clear
		    enough.


Utilizing "INVEST" the following Definition of Ready applies to the Outdoore app. 

User stories are small and well-defined with:

- A title
- A description
- Additional details (when applicable)
- Fibonacci estimate story point value

And:
- Are understandable
- Are valuable
- Are testable
