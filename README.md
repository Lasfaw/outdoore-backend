## Product Vision

### Near Vision
---
Our near vision is based on the high level features of the app. The system will have a login page for users to login or create profiles.

The users would be able to create & delete profiles while also being able to upload photos. The system will allow users to connect to Instagram and also be able to view other user's Instagram profiles. The system will collect information about based on their interests, skills, and attitude/personality. The system will have an algroithm that allows users to swipe left/right on another user's profile. The system will have in-app messaging for users to communicate with each other.
<br/>

### Far Vision
---
Our far vision is based on low level features. For example, users will be able to pick between 15mi radius and up to 50 mi radius. Users will be able to block or hide profiles from certain users of their choice. If a user likes another user enough after their adventure they will be given the option to rate them and also go on another adventure with them, should they choose to do so.

### Backlog Ordering Rationale
To order our backlog we first wrote out a foundation of user stories we felt covered the primary functionality of the application. We then grouped those user stories by their similarity and came up with four main epics. The epics are: user profile, user matching, in-app messaging, and third-party integrations. We then prioritized those epics based on logical ordering of how they should be delivered. This grouping and ordering of stories allows us to focus on building out the foundation of the primary features of the application, which we can iterate on later if needed.
